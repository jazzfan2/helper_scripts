Run the following routine *EVERY TIME* if any resource(s) in $HOME/.Xresources and/or $HOME/.app-defaults/XFile
have been modified, and the item order in the XFile ToolsMenu appears to have changed from the
desired (and previously set) order:

1. In $HOME/.app-defaults, set the positionIndex of *all* ToolsMenu items to 0, run xrdb, open a new XFile window, and click Tools;

2. Arrange all ToolsMenu items in the order they appear from top to bottom in the ToolsMenu;

3. After each item, enter the *desired* "RANKING POSITION" in the ToolsMenu, with 0 for the top position;

4. Give the item found at the bottom a "STACKING POSITION" of 0, and determine the ranking position assigned to this item;

5. Now iterate through the item list, moving up one position at a time, and perform steps 6 and 7 for each item.

6. Compare the ranking of the item under consideration to that of all previously passed items in the list.

7. Assign the item under consideration a (current) STACK POSITION equal to the number of previously passed items with a *smaller* RANKING POSITION.

8. Once all toolsMenu items have been passed through, enter the found STACK POSITION for each item in $HOME/.app-defaults/XFile as the new positionIndex.

Note: ToolsMenu items can have the same stack position, as this is a current value.
