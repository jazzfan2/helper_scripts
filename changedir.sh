# Author: R.J.Toscani
# Date: 14th of October 2025
# Description:
# Change to specified directory in active file-manager window-pane, resulting in a
# new file-manager window-pane of similar position and size as before changing directory.
#
# The program takes the to-be-specified directory as an argument. The active
# file-manager window is being derived by the program by finding its parent's process-ID
# and subsequently the related window-ID.
#
# 'changedir.sh' keeps track of whether or not the window was a result of splitting by
# the program 'split_panes.sh' thus allowing re-uniting with related (split) window panes.
# It does so by consulting and editing the latter programs's relations-file if present.

# Meant to be launched from the tools-menu of the file-manager named 'XFile' (EMWM)
# by Alexander Pampuchin - https://fastestcode.org (LGPLv3, MIT License).
