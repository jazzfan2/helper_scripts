# Name: mount_volumes.sh
# Author: R.J.Toscani
# Date: 22 oktober 2025
# Description: Mount/unmount selected volume(s).
# Meant to be used with XFile (p/o 'Enhanced Motif Window Manager'
# by Alexander Pampuchin - https://fastestcode.org/ LGPLv3, MIT License).
#
# Reason for developing this program was to work around following bug(?):
# Primary X-selected filenames containing spaces aren't properly handled by '%n'
# in the 'XFile.tools'-resource if this has the form: xterm -e '<command> \"%n\""
# resulting in undesired word-splitting even if %n is surrounded by escaped quotes.
# (Perhaps this is undefined 'xterm -e' behaviour if the part between quotes contains
# more than just a command name and arguments as described in man xterm for option -e)
