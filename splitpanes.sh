#!/bin/bash
# Name: splitpanes.sh
# Author: R.J.Toscani
# Date: 12th of October 2025
# Description:
# Splitting of selected file-manager window-pane into two side-by-side panes showing
# same directory, sharing same total area and position as a pair as before splitting.
# Repeated splitting is supported. Each pair of split panes is actually two new windows
# replacing their parent window.
# The program takes the (current) directory (within the active file manager window)
# as an argument. The active file manager window itself is being derived by the program
# by finding its parent's process-ID and subsequently the related window-ID.
#
# Meant to be launched from the tools-menu of the file-manager named 'XFile' (part of 
# 'Enhanced Motif Window Manager' by Alexander Pampuchin
# - https://fastestcode.org/ - LGPLv3, MIT License).
#
# Option -u re-unites all (recursively) split panes in the directory of the selected pane,
# in size and position of the original window (i.e. the first one, which did not originate
# by splitting itself).
#
# XFile Toolsmenu items for splitting and uniting could e.g. be accelerated by assigning
# F8 and F9 keys respectively.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - xfile
# - xdotool
# - wmctrl
